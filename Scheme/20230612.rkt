Write a function, called fold-left-right, that computes both fold-left and fold-right, returning them in a pair. Very
important: the implementation must be one-pass, for efficiency reasons, i.e. it must consider each element of the
input list only once; hence it is not correct to just call Schemeâ€™s fold-left and -right.
Example: (fold-left-right string-append "" '("a" "b" "c")) is the pair ("cba" . "abc").

(define (fold-left-right f s L)
  (let loop ((left s)
             (right (lambda (x) x))
             (xs L))
    (if (null? xs)
        (cons left (right s))
        (loop (f (car xs) left)
               (lambda (x) (right (f (car xs) x)))
               (cdr xs)))))

(fold-left-right string-append "" '("a" "b" "c"))

MA CHE PORCO DIO E' STA ROBA??
